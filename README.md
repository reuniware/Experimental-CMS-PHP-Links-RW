# PHP-Links-RW

This is a project about having quickly a web page deployed on a PHP + MySql server, with management of displayed links.

You have to set your MySql parameters in the PHP file at the beginning of the file.
You also have to set your IP address for allowing yourself to edit the list of displayed URLs.
